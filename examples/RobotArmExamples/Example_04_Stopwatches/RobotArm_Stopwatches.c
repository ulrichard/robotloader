 * Example: Robotarm stopwatches
 * Author(s): Hein wielink
			  Huy Nguyen 
 * ****************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * A small demo program, to show how to use the stopwatches
 * feature of the Robotarm Library for timing purposes.
 *
 * Just to show that we can do several things "in parallel", we have four 
 * "tasks" here. "task" is really ment as task, this is __NOT__ multitasking!
 * Not at all. 
 * --> We are not really performing these things in parallel, but it looks 
 * like this for someone looking at the mikrocontroller from the outside. 
 *
 * These four tasks can do rather complex things - not only these simple
 * things like in this program. This will be shown later in the more complex
 * example programs.
 *
 * You can understand better what this program does when you just let it run 
 * and watch the LEDs and the text output in the terminal!
 *
 * There are eight stopwatches in total, which you can use for whatever you 
 * want. You can even implement more stopwatches with one of those stopwatches
 * e.g. with 50ms resolution for other things you need to do.   
 * Please keep in mind that this is no accurate timing! It depends on how many 
 * stopwatches you use and how complex the tasks you need to perform are and
 * what else your program does. 
 * You should not use blocking delays like mSleep when you use stopwatches! 
 * Short delays e.g. sleep(50) (5ms) are usually OK but you should not use 
 * it too often.
 *

 * The Robot does NOT move in this example! You can simply put it on a table
 * next to your PC and you should connect it to the PC via the USB Interface!
